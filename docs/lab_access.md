# Accesing the lab

For this lab we will be using [Azure Lab Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/lab-services/). Azure Lab Services lets you create managed labs, such as classroom labs. The service itself handles all the infrastructure management for a managed lab, from spinning up VMs to handling errors, and scaling the infrastructure. The managed labs are currently in preview. Once the preview ends, the new lab types and existing DevTest Labs come under the new common umbrella name of Azure Lab Services where all lab types continue to evolve.
